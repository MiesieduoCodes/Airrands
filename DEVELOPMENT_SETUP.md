# 🚀 Airrands Development Setup Guide

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Expo Notifications Compatibility
**Problem**: Expo Go doesn't support push notifications in SDK 53+
**Solution**: 
- Added detection for Expo Go environment
- Graceful fallback when notifications aren't available
- Better error handling for notification registration

### 2. ✅ AsyncStorage Error
**Problem**: `Cannot read property 'setItem' of undefined` during login/logout
**Solution**:
- Fixed error handling in storage utility
- Added proper try-catch blocks
- Prevented app crashes from storage errors
- Made all storage operations non-blocking
- Added AsyncStorage availability checks
- Implemented in-memory fallback storage
- Added storage initialization testing

### 3. ✅ Network Request Failures
**Problem**: Push token registration failing with network errors
**Solution**:
- Added proper error handling for network requests
- Graceful degradation when services are unavailable
- Better logging for debugging

## 🛠️ Development Options

### Option 1: Continue with Expo Go (Limited Features)
```bash
npm start
# or
expo start
```
**Limitations**:
- ❌ No push notifications
- ❌ Some native features may not work
- ✅ Quick development and testing

### Option 2: Use Development Build (Full Features) - RECOMMENDED
```bash
# Build development APK
npm run build-dev

# Or manually:
eas build --platform android --profile development
```

**Steps**:
1. Install the development APK on your device
2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev-client
   # or
   expo start --dev-client
   ```
3. Scan QR code with your development build app

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Full push notification support
- ✅ All native features work
- ✅ Production-like environment

## 📱 Building Development Build

### Prerequisites
```bash
# Install EAS CLI globally
npm install -g @expo/eas-cli

# Login to EAS
eas login
```

### Build Commands
```bash
# Quick build (uses helper script)
npm run build-dev

# Manual build
npm run build-dev-android

# Preview build (for testing)
npm run build-preview
```

### After Building
1. Download APK from EAS dashboard
2. Install on your Android device
3. Run `npm run dev-client`
4. Scan QR code with development build app

## 🔧 Configuration Files

### app.json
- ✅ Firebase configuration included
- ✅ EAS project ID configured
- ✅ All necessary permissions set

### eas.json
- ✅ Development build profile configured
- ✅ Preview and production profiles ready

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Push notifications not supported"**
   - This is expected in Expo Go
   - Use development build for full notification support

2. **Storage errors during login/logout**
   - Fixed in latest version
   - Errors are now logged but don't crash the app
   - All storage operations are now non-blocking
   - Added fallback to in-memory storage when persistent storage fails
   - Storage availability is tested on app startup

3. **Network request failures**
   - Check internet connection
   - Verify Firebase configuration
   - Errors are now handled gracefully

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Check EAS login status
eas whoami

# View build history
eas build:list

# Check project configuration
eas project:info
```

## 📋 Next Steps

1. **For Development**: Use development build for full feature testing
2. **For Production**: Use production build profile
3. **For Testing**: Use preview build profile

## 🎯 Key Improvements Made

- ✅ Better error handling throughout the app
- ✅ Graceful degradation for unsupported features
- ✅ Improved logging for debugging
- ✅ Development build configuration
- ✅ Helper scripts for easier development

Your app should now run without the previous errors, and you have the option to use a development build for full feature support!
